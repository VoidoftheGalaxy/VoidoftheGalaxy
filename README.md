<h1>Hi and welcome to my profile!</h1>

<p>My name is @VoidoftheGalaxy and I am new here.<p>
<p>I am fascinated by programming and decided to learn it on my own.<p>
<p>Everything I know so far is self-taught through various online tutorials or through websites like "freecodecamp".<p>
<p>I would love to be part of this community and collaborate with others on the same path as me!<p>
<h3>But the most important thing is, I love to create new things and learn something new every day.</h3>
